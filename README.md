## The reason I start creative coding ?
Since **elementary school** , I was interseted in **drawing** and learnt about 3 years . ( particular in realistic painting , sketch or colored pencil sketch is the majority

In the **junior high school** , I studied all day instead of participate in after-school activities.

In the **senior high school**  , coding and studying take most of my time . (Note. competitive programming contest 

After GSAT(General Scholastic Ability Test) , I have more time to build some side project. 

At the last semester in senior high school , there are two course related to art that needs final-project. 

However , I have already lost the feel to drawing ...

In the mean time , NFT got viral in Taiwan , which inspire me that I could still "draw" using "programming" ability !

（ BTW , I start creative coding just for myself insted of following the trend of NFT 

## p5.js
After searching on the Internet about generative art 

Serveral artworks were "drawn" by `p5.js` , which is a Javascript libarary

The community of `p5.js` is large , there are numerous turtorials and artists contribuite to it.

In addition , the synatx of `p5.js` is beginner-friendly , there are lots of well-programmed function allow user to utilize instead of building by themselves (For instance , 3D `noise` function


## Processing


`processing` is designed to make coding accessible and inclusive for artists and designers

( They wouldn't be bounded by the UI setting of illustration software etc... 

`p5.js`is an interpretation of`processing` language

( It's writtern in `Javascript` , so it can be execute on the browser , on the other hand , the `Event Listener` feature chould make the artworks more interactive .


## Open Processing 
`Open Processing`is the mojor gallery of`p5.js`

Artists show their masterpiece on the platform ( BTW , the user could see their raw code , which is the best opportunity to learn how to achieve to that kind of effect .

### Reference：

These are some reference that I learn several skill of `p5.js` from .

Also share some amazing artists that I like .
